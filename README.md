### Hi there 👋


- 🦑 I am a hybrid engineer/scientist/artist and former academic currently working in software engineering.

- 🧑‍💻 My original training is in Computer Music with emphasis on building software tools and signal processing algorithms for spectral/spatial manipulation. I have deep training in traditional Computer Science and significant experience in machine learning/AI with emphasis on reinforcement learning and signal classification in the computational neuroscience and robotics domains. My phd/post-doctoral training was in Neuroengineering (developing electrical therapeutics for brain tumors) with additional work in Bioinformatics.
